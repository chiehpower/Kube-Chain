# Install Kubeflow

All source from : [Official tutorial](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/installation/localcluster-deployment/)

```
$ kind get clusters
kind

$ kind version
kind v0.9.0 go1.15.2 linux/amd64
```

Creating a cluster on kind
```
kind create cluster
```

This will bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using a pre-built node image.
You can find that image on the Docker Hub kindest/node here.
If you wish to build the node image yourself, you can use the kind build node-image commandâ€”see the official building image section for more details. And, to specify another image, use the --image flag.

By default, the cluster will be given the name kind. Use the --name flag to assign the cluster a different context name.

### Deploying Kubeflow Pipelines

To deploy the Kubeflow Pipelines, run the following commands:
```
export PIPELINE_VERSION=1.0.4
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/cluster-scoped-resources?ref=$PIPELINE_VERSION"
```
Output:
```
